### Links
- Live Site URL: [https://melanie-cabriales.github.io/Social-Links/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

I learned how to import google fonts to be used in VSCode projects.

I was figuring out how to animate an image in the background of it but I didnt stick with it because it wasnt exactly what I imagined

In terms of code snippets I was proud of:

```html
    <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Melanie-Cabriales"><button class="bsize">Frontend Mentor</button></a>
```
I intially thought I had to only use a button but then I realized to get the link to work I had to create the button inside the anchor tag with a href attribute.

```css
    .bsize:hover {
    background-color: #58408C ;
    color: aliceblue ;
    }
```
It was cool learning that I could make the buttons seem interactive and dynamic with only css by changing the button and text color when the pointer is hovering over.


### Continued development

<!-- Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect. -->

I think in the future I want to go more into the adding dynamic background elements with JS and learn more about the gsap library and how I can utilize it in my coding projects. 
 

### Useful resources
